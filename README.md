# 👋 Hi! I'm Nereo

If you don't know me, let me quickly introduce myself. I started off my career as a Software Engineer almost 15 years ago, and later I moved to different positions
like Scrum Master, Engineering Manager, Innovation Manager and currently Head of Engineering. Still, I try to find as much time as I can to keep learning and improving on the 
technical side 😁

Aside of that, I started the Ionic community here in Barcelona back in 2015 (and handed it over when I relocated to Germany for a year in 2016) and I also give trainings 
on different technologies and methodologies from time to time (Development, Automation, DevOps,  Agile...)


## 👀 My Interests
Yes, I am passionate about new technolgies and people. Really enjoy my time with my teams. But there are few things I love aside of development (and everything around). 
Sports (football and especially voleyball) and music are my main hobbies. But overall, spending time with my wife and my family is what I enjoy the most. 

## 🌱 What I learnt and what I will
When it comes to official education I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and also in Multimedia. I also have a Master's degree in Artificiall Intelligence.
About certifications, I hold several MCPs and a MCSD from Microsoft, PMP, Professional Scrum Master and SAFe Agilist.
Despite formal education or certification, I think learning mostly happens everyday during our interactions with others, and I am lucky that I met amazing colleagues 
all throughout my career from whom I could learn and still do.
